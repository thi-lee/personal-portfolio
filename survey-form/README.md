# Survey Form
11/27/2020

## Introduction

At Khan Academy Vietnam, interns get a chance to biweekly host a coaching session. The 6 teams of us will collaborate in pairs to create a two- to three-hour event that delivers high-quality contents with real-life applications. 

My team, Us Before Khan, and our partners, Seniors and Sunrise, decided our topic would be about Mental Breakdown. We have noticed in our daily interactions with each other and with students in high schools and colleges that mental breakdown isn't taken seriously. 

In this coaching session, we will have activities to get interns familiarized with the topic, and there will be two guest speakers, one of whom is an expert in the field and the other has experienced and overcome mental breakdown. The two guest speakers will talk about what mental breakdown is, how to avoid it, and how to get better after one "runs into it." 

This survey was a copy of the inital form sent out early in our preparation timeline, because we want to know what the public knowledge/interest is on the topic.
