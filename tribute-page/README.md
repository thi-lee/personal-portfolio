# Sal Khan Tribute Page
11/26/2020

## Introduction 
When I think of Sal Khan, there are two things that pop up in my mind: the green color and the black board.

It's easy to say "I go on Khan Academy to learn," but it's harder to learn about its founder and his vision for the world education. 

This fall, I got a chance to intern at Khan Academy Vietnam, an adaptation of Khan Academy in my home country. Our intern team of 30 people with a few senior translators and full-time employees work hard to translate the videos and exercise contents, as well as designing the website. 

And with that, I came to appreciate more the work of people who are behind the green logo and the black board. I am fully aware that it's not just Sal Khan. It's a whole team. 

Yet this tribute page is dedicated to Sal Khan because from him it all started.

## Objective
• Familarize with `HTML` and `CSS`, and sucessfully apply these to create a website with a good structure and great visual layout. <br>
• Understand what brought Sal Khan to where he is today and what his vision for the future is like.

## Structure
This `khan-tribute-page` repository mainly includes:
    • `README.md`, which is this that you are reading.
    • `index.html`, the backbone of this page.
    • `css/main.css`, which contains the main styling.
    • `css/reset.css`, which resets the default of `CSS` on different browsers.

Since I am mostly focusing on `HTML` and `CSS` and have not worked with JavaScript, this web page won't use JavaScript for interactive effects. There may be, in the future, and I for sure will have it updated.
